 * Yesterday Ben hacked the school's database and fired his CS teacher; he
 * couldn't solve a coding challenge that Ben sent him via email. The teacher
 * didn't appreciate it and locked Ben's access to any advanced software. ðŸ¤¬
 * 
 * Your task is to help Ben with today's practice and print rhodonea curve using
 * terminal.
 * 
 * Use 100 by 100 grid. Magnitude is 45. Use ' ' as an empty cell, '@' as your
 * 'pen'. Change your Î¸ with 0.01Â° (degrees; you can assume that by default it's
 * already in degrees) step, but don't forget to use radians with your
 * trigonometric functions.
 * 
 * Since most of the values are a float value, round it to the nearest integer.
 * Place it at the center of the grid.
 * 
 * [execution time limit] 16 seconds (js)
 * 
 * [input] integer n
 * 
 * [input] integer d
 * 
 * [output] array.string
